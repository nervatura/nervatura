## Overview

Documents created with [**REPORT TEMPLATE**](/docs/client/program/editor) (offer, order, invoice, etc.) can be supplemented with additional information.
- You may specify a **longer text**, which may vary for each transaction and can provide the customers with additional information on the delivery terms, warranty rights, opening hours, etc.
- **Simple formatting** can also be made to the texts: bold, italic fonts, lists, indents.
- From text **predefined text templates** can be created. The text templates are stored as document types in the program.
- For each document type a **default text template** can be defined. These will be loaded 
and saved by  the program for each newly created document automatically.

## Operations

### NEW TEMPLATE

### DELETE
Delete the selected text template.

### SET DEFAULT
To make the selected text template default.

### LOAD FROM...
Loading the selected template text. 

### SAVE TO...
Save the edited text of the selected template.

When the text template is loaded the text in the field will be overwritten, and when it is saved the text in the template will be the amended one!
