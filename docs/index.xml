      <description>Overview #  The stock inventory list shows the availability of goods by quantities. However in some cases it might be needed to have the possibility to follow up a certain item individually. In this case it gets a unique identifier, specific data can be connected to it through additional data, events can be assigned, and also its move can be tracked.
A typical example could be the management of company cars, which requires recording of many different data types and events.</description>

      <description>Overview #  PRODUCTION helps to produce new products from raw material stored in the warehouses. The inventory level will decrease by the amount of raw materials used, and the manufactured new product quantity will appear in stock. The data sheet tracks the material usage. If other costs, resource usage (eg. used energy, time spent, tool used etc.) is needed to be tracked, then through additional data it can be linked to WORKSHEET forms as well.</description>

      <description>Overview #  Production of a product in some cases might require significant amount of raw materials. It can occur as well that the same product can also be produced from different components. In these cases, the work with PRODUCTION forms can be sped up by FORMULA data sheets prepared for the products to be manufactured.
These can also be imagined as production recipes for a product. All the raw material requirements of the product can be specified for a given quantity.</description>

      <description>Overview #  The REPORT EDITOR is used to modify some of the Nervatura Report definitions and descriptions of REPORT TEMPLATE. It defines the layout of the reports: where and how the data should appear. It will not support changes regarding what data should be displayed from the database, but will give the possibility to modify the report with additional information (eg. logo files, texts, language translations). Therefore this tool is not suitable for creating completely new reports, however the existing reports can freely be modified and by using copies additional versions can be created.</description>
