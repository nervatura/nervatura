      <h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
      <p>General data model, which can store all information generated
				during the operation of a classic organization. This includes all
				manufacturer, retailer and service companies (or government units)
				which operation can be defined and described within a <b>GOODS</b> (we want
				to sell or we supply) – <b>CLIENT</b> (we work for) - <b>RESOURCE</b> (we possess
				for the task) triangle.</p>
      <p>It is located between the applications, surfaces that are using
				and creating the data and the real data storage layer. It defines
				logical objects; data is stored in these freely defined attributes
				and in relations between them. Its flexible structure allows
				defining new properties or assigning events to our objects.</p>
			<p>The number of objects is minimal, their structure is simple. It
				has an easy to learn, perspicuous and usable logic. However it is
				capable to store the required data in structures. It ensures the
				possibility to attach defined type features of any kind to each
				object and also makes the objects linkable to each other
				arbitrarily.</p>
			<p>The data model is independent from data storage layer. In the
				functions of implementation the concrete data storage can be
				realized by any optional method or device but as a main requirement
				the user of the data model must not sense this at all.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img src="/images/nom.png" width="325" height="259"></td>
          <td style="vertical-align:top;padding:0em 1em;">Such <b><i>pre-defined functional roles</i></b> which can have any type of
				    attributions, events can be attached to them as well as their
				    elements can be attached to elements of other objects.</td>
        </tr>

      <h3><a name="base_object">Base objects</a></h3>
      <p><span class="nobj">CUSTOMER</span> 
        - all external partners of the company, including the buyer, consumer and supplier side <br> 
        <span class="nobj">PRODUCT</span> - all raw materials,
				semi-finished and end-products that are related to our activity (as
				customer or vendor), produced by us as a manufacturer or offered as
				service <br> 
				<span class="nobj">TOOL, EMPLOYEE, PLACE</span> resources which are
				available for executing the activity and they contribute to it.
				These can be human resources (EMPLOYEE), material devices, tools,
				machines (TOOL) or financial, potentially infrastructural conditions
				such as warehouses, bank account, petty cash (PLACE)
			</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="fields">Features</a></h3>
      <p>All data that <b><i>describes a given object</i></b>, we want to attach to it
				as information. Some of them are pre-defined but further ones can
				freely be defined for any of the objects.</p>
			<p>
				<i>When using the Nervatura Data Interface (NDI) a feature of an
					object which has not existed before- is automatically generated
					when the first value is given. If we create a new feature in this
					way then its type is unidentifiable thus it will be automatically
					text. However by defining the exact type of certain features, we
					could easily ensure that the stored data is correct. </i>
			</p>
			<p>By using the <span class="nobj">DEFFIELD</span> object we can define data storage features
				for other objects. Besides the classical data types (bool, integer,
				float, date, string, notes) these can contain list of values
				(valuelist), url links (urlink) or references to concrete components
				of other objects (customer, product, tool, employee, etc.).</p>
      <p>
				<i>When using NDI, values of features defined in this way can be set
					in the object component with the name of the feature and can be
					queried as well.</i>
			</p>
			<p>Through the <span class="nobj">FIELDVALUE</span> object every defined feature of components
				of all objects can be queried.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="events">Events</a></h3>
      <p><b><i>Extended, generally time and interval bound object features.</i></b>
				With the help of events we can make the static features of an object
				into dynamic so the feature of a given component is able to take
				various values at different times. An event can also be valid for a
				period of time, so having a start and an end date. Optional number
				of supplementary data of a given object can be attached to it as
				well as it can be grouped.</p>
      <p>We can manage the events through the <span class="nobj">EVENT</span> object. Beside the
				base object we can also assign events to projects.</p>
		</li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="trans">Transaction</a></h3>
      <p>Transaction <b><i>is such a sort of event to which at least two base
				objects are joined.</i></b></p>
			<p>
				An event is always attached to a given object. As a further event
				feature another base object can be granted but it's just an optional
				additional data in this case.<br> 
				In the transactions the relation
				between the base objects is an indispensable and essential component
				of the given event. The transaction doesn’t belong to any of the
				base objects but the base objects are joined to a transaction. From
				these some base objects might be optional components but at least
				two should be indispensable part of it.
			</p>
      <p>The most common object pair is the customer and product
				relationship (e.g.: offer, order, invoice) but any other combination
				is also possible, for example product-place (stock management),
				customer-tool (rental), employee-customer (worksheet) etc.</p>
			<p>We can link additional data to transactions just as to events, but
				in contrary to events, here we don’t use the features of the linked
				base object but we can declare own, additional data. Transactions
				can also be linked to each other or can "originate" from each other,
				for instance offer -> order -> inventory move -> invoice.</p>
			<p>The object of transactions is the <span class="nobj">TRANS</span> which contains the main
				data of transactions as well as the single object relations. <span class="nobj">ITEM</span>
				object contains PRODUCT lines linked to transactions, <span class="nobj">PAYMENT</span> object
				contains financial settlements, <span class="nobj">MOVEMENT</span> object contains warehouse
				and device movements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="link">Relations</a></h3>
      <p>
				There are several options to link single objects. Usually the object
				has the possibility of applying the one to one relation by default,
				if it is required so by its type. In case of need the additional
				data pointing to the proper type of object can also be generated at
				any time.<br> 
				For example we can set a customer type feature for
				CUSTOMER object wherewith we can link a given customer to another
				customer. With the same method one to many relations can also be
				set, so in this case we can also link our customer to some other
				customers.
			</p>
			<p>If any linked customer is also linked to an other customer it
				results in a many to many relation.<br> 
				<span class="nobj">LINK</span> object can also be used to
				set relations to objects. This way two objects can be linked without
				giving further object features.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="groups">Group settings</a></h3>
      <p>Several options are available for grouping the objects. Using
				supplementary data, further to data storage opportunities allows
				also grouping to a certain degree.</p>
			<p>In the <span class="nobj">GROUPS</span> object we can create groups by object types. If
				needed, further features can be defined for these groups. These can
				then be used for assignments of pre-defined values on a given object
				(for example type options), but through LINK object can also be used
				for creating classical one to many groups (for example customer of
				product groups).</p>
			<p>Actually the <span class="nobj">PROJECT</span> object can be applicable as the extension of
				GROUPS object. Surely it is possible to set additional data features
				here as well but at PROJECT object temporal extension is also
				possible, just like it is in case of events vs. features. Optionally
				it can have start or end date, we can also link it to customers or
				places. Projects can also have their own events as well as any
				transaction can be linked to them.</p>
		</li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="complex">Complex data types</a></h3>
      <p>When adding features to objects in some cases complex data
				feature setting is needed. Essentially <b><i>these are such sub objects
				which possess own features.</i></b> For example if we want to add
				address data to a customer then by setting the address we can give
				the city, the zip code or the name of the street as well.<br>
				Some complex data types can be linked not only a single object but the
				same element can also be attached to many others. In some of them it
				is possible to define further additional data.
			</p>
			<p>One to many linked sub objects: <br>
			  <span class="nobj">ADDRESS</span>,
				<span class="nobj">BARCODE</span>, <span class="nobj">CONTACT</span>, 
				<span class="nobj">PRICE</span></p>
			<p>One to one linked sub objects: <br>
			  <span class="nobj">CURRENCY, PATTERN, RATE, TAX</span>
			</p>
		</li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="other_object">Other objects</a></h3>
      <p>The objects of rights management, logging and other options: <br> 
				<span class="nobj">LOG</span>, 
				<span class="nobj">NUMBERDEF</span></p>
		</li>
    <li>
      <h3><a name="ui_object">User interface objects</a></h3>
      <p>These objects <b><i>are not parts of the object model</i></b>, they are not
				needed for recording the workflow data. However certain applications
				to ensure their own operation might require data storage
				possibilities.<br> 
				<i>These objects are not or not fully supported by
				the functions of NDI, though they are available through the
				Nervatura Programming Interface (NPI).</i>
			</p>
