    <p>Nervatura is a business management framework. It can handle any type 
      of business related information, starting from customer details, up to shipping, 
      stock or payment information.</p>
    <p>The main aspects of its design were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>simple and transparent structure</li>
      <li>capability of storing different data types of an average company</li>
      <li>effective, easily expandable and secure data storage</li>
      <li>support of several database types</li>
      <li>well documented, easy data management</li>

        It is a general <b>open-data model</b>, which can store all information generated 
        in the operation of a usual corporation.

        <p>This covers all manufacturer, retailer and service companies (or 
          governmental units) where the business operation can be defined and 
          described within a GOODS (items, services to be sold, provided) – 
          CLIENT (the recipient of goods) - RESOURCE (assets used to produce 
          the goods) triangle.</p>
        <p>It is located between the application surfaces that are using
          and creating the data and the real data storage layer. It defines
          logical objects; data is stored in these freely defined attributes
          and in relations between them. Its flexible structure allows
          defining new properties or assigning events to our objects.</p>
        <p>Mainly it was created with the aim to support developers in
          focusing on the presentation layer i.e. an efficient and easy to use
          user interface. There is no need for special database planning
          knowledge and time saving benefit is gained. Thus, they are
          provided with a safe, scalable (flexibly following the increasing
          data storage need and potential complexity) and easy to port
          (database independent) device for data storage.</p>
        <p>Other point of view was to realize an important management
          development principle. Namely, to separate the management
          applications from data generated in certain processes. The purpose
          is to ensure that companies using the applications have complete
          access to their own data in all cases. The physical possession of a
          database is not sufficient to reach this goal. The possibility of
          proper interpretation and availability for further usage of stored
          data must also be ensured.</p>
        <p>Data stored in the <b>NOM</b> are independent from the applications
          that are using them. This also means that in this sense the programs
          written for <b>NOM</b> are also compatible with each other. This ensures
          the easy change not only between two identical programs of the same
          role. Companies having NOM can easily use variety of applications
          written for different platforms (PC, mobile devices, data
          gatherings, etc) and different technologies (HTML5, java, flash,
          traditional programming languages, etc) in order to support their
          processes.</p>

        <p>Data of usage rights/levels and proper database access settings
          are stored here. Further, database independent, user or application
          level functions can also be implemented here.<br>
          The <b>NAS</b> doesn’t store
          data related to workflow management but information needed for
          accessing these data. The client databases, server databases can
          also be placed here but those can be located anywhere else in the
          world as well.</p>
        <p>The <b>NAS</b> is based on the <a href="http://expressjs.com/" 
          target="_blank">Express</a> web application framework technology and
          uses its security solutions. Through handling databases of
          <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> 
          it supports numerous drivers such as SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL,
          MSSQL. Each of them can be chosen for data storage and the
          types can also be exchanged at any time. In Nervatura applications
          the data access is independent from the type of storage.</p>
        <p>The Admin graphical user interface (NAS ADMIN) is part of
          <b>NAS</b> project. For instance it can be used for setting of certain user rights or
          database accesses. Remote access to this could be limited because of
          safety reasons.</p>

        It is a non-graphical, command-based user interface. 
        The purpose was to create an easy to learn, simple and safe function
        library. Its usage is mainly beneficial for those users who want to
        query or transmit information to a Nervatura client database for any
        purpose.

        <p>Potential utilization area for example: creating backups, data
          migration, sending or receiving data to or from other applications
          (for instance accounting systems, analytical data supply, etc), data
          source for analytical reports, loading data from offline
          applications, adding exchange rates, financial indexes, etc.</p>
        <p>Main advantages and specifics of usage:  
        <ul>
          <li>The structure of functions follows the logic of
            workflow management, it’s not necessary to know and understand
            the data storage principles and exact structure of the database.</li>
          <li>The functions can easily be called from anywhere with any
            device or programming language embedded in http requests which are
            optionally encoded and encrypted.</li>
          <li>Several format types can be called as results of queries
            such as html, json, xml, csv.</li>
          <li>Update for functions is centrally provided in case of
            potential database changes, also backward compatibility is
            assured. It makes it easy to maintain the automated tasks as no
            further resources are needed for updates.</li>
          <li>During entering new data, the <b>NOM</b> object attribute -which
            has not existed before- is automatically generated when the first
            value is given.</li>
          <li>With <b>NDI</b> data integrity problems can be avoided when
            inserting or updating data, which means the queried information is
            certainly composed well and the uploaded data stored properly. The
            built-in rule system also indicates the logical errors.</li>

        Ensures direct access to Nervatura databases at database management

        <p>With its help we can send and receive data without knowing the
